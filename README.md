# CLEARER
Essential gene prediction across eukaryotes by machine learning.
Please find the preprint of CLEARER on https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.439934v1.
Attention!
Feature generation is exemplified for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Feature generation and machine learning is time consuming and all data sets with generated features as well as trained machines can be send upon request
Feature names and tools to generate them are listed in "Feature_description.csv". Any questions to thomasbeder7@gmail.com.

Specific questions about Cofactory NetCGlyc NetNGlyc, NetOGlyc, ProP, SignalP, TargetP, TMHMM, YinOYang, NetworkX and gene set features to phemmysmart@gmail.com.
CodonW (http://codonw.sourceforge.net/) features and DeepLoc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) were generated by the tools without modification. Question about CodonW or DeepLoc to phemmysmart@gmail.com.
