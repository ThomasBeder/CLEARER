Feature generation and machine learning is time consuming and all data sets with generated features as well as trained machines can be send upon request (thomasbeder7@gmail.com)
Feature names and tools to generate them are listed in "Feature_description.csv" 

CodonW (http://codonw.sourceforge.net/) features and DeepLoc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) were generated by the tools without modification. Question about CodonW or DeepLoc to phemmysmart@gmail.com.
